# Oxdraw window management library

Oxdraw application desktop window management library. This library is built on top of [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) for handling window management. This library manages window creation, lifecycle, updates and exposes API for creating new windows. It wraps around the [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) package to provide an easy to use API for launching the application.
